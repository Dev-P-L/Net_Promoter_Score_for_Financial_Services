# Highlights

As expressed by Qualtrics about NPS^®^, "[NPS® is often held up as the gold standard customer experience metric.](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/?rid=ip&prevsite=en&newsite=uk&geo=FR&geomatch=uk)" For the banking and financial services in particular, Cvetilena Gocheva writes on the CustomerGauge website that this CX metric "[has never been more important](https://customergauge.com/benchmarks/blog/financial-services-nps-benchmarks)".

In this paper, interactive NPS visualization and analysis are applied to a Kaggle NPS dataset. As described on the Kaggle website, it is a "[dataset from 2021, generated using real distributions of NPS data from a retail bank](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charlottetu/npsbank)". This paper is comprised of market segmentation, temporal analysis – by quarter, month, and week –, and cohort analysis. Developments have been made in R and R Markdown. 

A complete output document has been produced in HTML format with interactive graphs, tables – interactive when this made sense –, and text; a partial output document has also been created in PowerPoint format with static graphs and tables. Both output documents are lodged in this GitHub repository.
